## Strategic and communication competencies based on strong technology and devices knowledge

I am an electrical engineer. I grew up surrounded by father’s tools and gadgets we used to build new tools and gadgets, hence planning, architecting and building tech solutions are all-natural to me.

### Technology
My all-time goal is to acquire “reusable knowledge”. This is why I am a generalist. I have experiences in many aspects of information technology: programming, artificial intelligence/machine learning, databases, IT operation, identity management, security, networking and so on.

### Strategy
For the last 7 years, I have been working with BDMs and CIOs to create and carry out an IT strategy that is aligned with their business priorities, based on phased infrastructure and business productivity maturity models.

Among many others, I helped to develop IT strategy for the following companies: Allianz, Audi, HM, Hungarian Post, Hungarian Telekom, MKB Bank, MOL, MTVA, MVMI, OTP Bank, Richter, Tigáz etc.

I believe an IT strategy can be successful if it is able to handle the two speeds required by the business continuity and the need to increase agility. BYOD is one of those needs today. This phenomenon was also recognized by Gartner on their recent symposium and has been referred by the term: “Bimodal IT”.
The solution to this dual speed is to transform the current device centric IT to a user centric IT. Usage patterns by corporate users can be classified to so-called Personas. These Personas describe the way the given user works in a certain situation. Usage patterns may vastly differ for Home Office, Helpdesk, Sales or Project worker scenarios, but the list is a lot longer. Personas may need different level of services, applications, security or even IT architecture (desktop, tablet, VDI, mobile client etc.). Ever further, a specific user may act as a Persona in the morning and act as a different Persona in the afternoon. E.g.:  work in the office, travel during the afternoon or work remote in the evening.

The goal is to remain productive by giving access to services and applications under changing working conditions, regardless where the user is located and what device he/she is using. The User centric IT (or Flexible Workstyle) methodology can support the Consumerization of IT with an intelligent infrastructure. It provides flexibility required by the different scenarios while maintaining end to end security.

To reach this level of flexibility, Personas need to be identified by examining different groups of colleagues. As a next step, different architectures need to be defined that serve the given Personas the best. Technologies like data encryption, information protection, mobile device management, cross platform mobile apps/desktop applications/web apps, application distribution, user-state virtualization, VPN or the transparent DirectAccess are equally important components here. As a third step, these architectures need to be deployed and operated.
 
### Devices
My other key focus area is connected devices. I am convinced that IoT (Internet of Things) will be a major story changer in the next few years. IoT has many technology aspects: sensors, communication, Big Data and Machine Learning, integration.
Having been working in the solution business and partner ecosystem for decades, I can architect IoT-based services that could be part of Telenor’s non-core business offering. Examples:
*	Cloud based home automation systems built on the top of Telenor’s LTE network.
*	Surveillance service for elderly people using fitness trackers, mobile phones.
*	Coke or sandwich dispensers, similarly to connected ATMs, could alert the service provider when product or cash change shortage is predicted in the near future, not after the fact.
*	Intelligent parking meters that collect parking habits to the cloud. Companion app for phones or smart watches display the nearest free parking slot – or the nearest street with the highest chance to have a free slot.
Current mobile parking apps have access to a parking service to start/stop parking, retrieve balance, get notifications etc. Using these services consumes data, which is the ultimate goal of an operator.

## Let’s see what IoT give add up to this solution!
IoT is a lot more than billions of connected devices, sensors. It is about the network, the data in the cloud, decision making, predictive algorithms (based on machine learning), reporting via self-service BI solutions and finally, consumer or business services at the end of the line.

If parking meters were connected devices (a data consumption device in every 50 meters), they cloud collect data and push them the cloud to a BigData solution. This way, the companion app could ask the cloud where the nearest free parking slot is. We reached a service that provides a lot more to the end user than simply start/stop parking.

But let’s go further! We cloud use Machine Learning (in other words, predictive AI technologies running on a big dataset) to decide, where the highest possibility is for a parking slot to get free in the next minute. The precision of this prediction depends on the amount of data it can work on.

The architecture of the solution:

In the end, we provided users a value added parking service that can show them the street that will have a free parking slot, even if there is not any at the moment.
Gartner says, if we want to innovate and looking for the directions, always put the question: “What would Google do if it was in our business?” I believe the above example shows that direction.

Following the Lean Startup methodology, the project could be tried out in small, with many phases (or sprints). Features could be added in a fast pace at a low risk based on continuous user feedback and telemetry data.

Parking meters log data to the cloud, where machine learning technologies predict the next available free slots. Mobile devices can subscribe to those alerts.
