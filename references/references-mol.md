## True Positive Fever Detection Smart Camera is used in MOL Headquarters

It was in March 2020. The CONVID-19 pandemic begun and according to the corporate policy, employees were mostly working from home. They were allowed to office under restricted conditions.

MOL Group wanted a system that can measure the temperature of people without degrading the check-in experience at the reception. That required a remote, seamless temperature metering solution. There is a number of such cameras on the market, but the prices of thermal sensors increase exponentially with the resolution. 

This is how True Positive comes into the picture. Our strategy is to downscale our devices to the bare minimum that is still able to fulfill the tasks. In many cases, this requires
* high levels of optimizations,
* balancing with available resources, 
* finding various correction algoritms, 
* calibrations, 
* predictions and ultimately: Machine Learning.

Today, MOL Group is running a True Positive camera prototype in its Headquarter corridoor to detect feverish colleagues or visitors. Since our cameras are extensible, interms of hardware and software as well, we are continuously developing our code to fit the customer's requirements. Thanks to the valuable feedback provided by the project teams from MOL's side during the past months, our product became ready for the enterprises.
